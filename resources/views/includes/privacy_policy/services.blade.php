                            <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.

                            <p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>
                            <ul style="text-align: justify;">

                            </ul>
                            <p>Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:</p>
